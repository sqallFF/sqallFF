### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James! I'm currently a student at Western Governors University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. Currently, I am working on IaC solutions within applicable NIST 800 - 171, 800-53, and Cloud Controls Matrix. Policy as Code solutions are of great interest to me on my journey as a cloud security engineer and future consultant. Aligning security with best practices and regulatory compliance will enable businesses to mitigate risk more effectively. There are teams of GRC Personnel out there, and I want to bridge the gap between GRC and engineering to allow for more effective communication up and down the chain of command. Lately, I have been preparing for the AWS Security Specialty exam. The most current in this repo will reflect AWS best practices along with architecture diagrams for security automation and alerting. Thanks for dropping by! If you're interested in my work,  please don't hesitate to send me a message. Thanks!
